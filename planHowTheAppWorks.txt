This plaintext document outlines my thought process on a re-write of
this application's Business Logic. I expect the User Interface Logic
to only marginally change. Refer to the prior Git commit history for
this app's first incarnation.


Expected input:

 - A size of pizza

 - A topping (multiple toppings might be offered later as a new

Expected output:

 - A pizza with the size and topping chosen by the user, and a price
   to buy it.


To achieve that, do this:

Define an object constructor Pizza with the following properties and
possible values.
