This plaintext document outlines my thought process on a re-write of
this application's Business Logic. I expect the User Interface Logic
to only marginally change. Refer to the Git commit history prior to
Saturday February 5th 2022 for this app's first incarnation.



Business Logic


Expected input:

 - A size of pizza

 - A pizza topping (multiple toppings might be offered later as a new
   feature)


Expected output:

 - A pizza with the size and topping chosen by the user, and a price
   to buy it.


To achieve that, do this:

Define an object constructor Pizza with the following properties and
possible values.

 - Size: 12 inch for small, 18 inch for medium, or 24 inch for large

 - Topping: cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, or anchovy

 - Size price: $6 for small, $9 for medium, or $12 for large

 - Topping price: $5 for cheese, $7 for pepperoni, $6 for artichoke,
   or $7 for anchovy

 - Total Price: the value of 'size price' plus the value of 'topping price'


Define a method calculateTotalPrice with parameters sizeChoice and
toppingChoice, from the UI Logic below, to calculate the total price.



User Interface Logic


HTML shows the following to the user:

 - Header of 'Choose your Pizza'.

 - Ask what size is wanted.
 
 - Offer radio button for each size choice.

 - Ask what topping is wanted.

 - Offer radio button for each topping choice.

 - Show submit and reset buttons.

 - Show an empty result tag.


In CSS, initially hide the result tag.


After the page has loaded, run the UI JavaScript below:

Run the code below on click of the 'submit' button.

 - Prevent the default of the form result appearing and then quickly
   disappearing.

 - Empty the tag with id result.

 - Store the value of size choice.

 - Store the value of topping choice.

 - Call the calculateTotalPrice method, in our Business Logic above,
   and pass it the values of sizeChoice, and toppingChoice.
